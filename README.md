Project Guidelines

The CMM004 module evaluates students’ ability to develop a software application as a team
using the Scrum framework. The project is divided into 3 “increments”. At the end of each
increment, students have to submit evidence of their team work, a personal reflection, and
demonstrate the deployable software product features.

# Project Topics
The project topic is usually a significant piece of software design and development work.
Each team will be given a project topic, which can be proposed or allocated by the tutor.
